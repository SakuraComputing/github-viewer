This project has been created using Create React App / React Hooks / Typescript and using Material UI I took these decisions at the planning stage. I've created a custom hook for the fetch and used a very basic approach ie. So the repo owners name needs to be entered I had in mind the number of hits the API could take in anhour would be 50 so any major searches would lead to problems. There's a filter and the Grid was quite good from UI prespective but I ran into problems with typescript. If I had had more time I would have created either a modal or an expanding grid row to show the extra details and also done more with the Readme I have hard coded a single line again due to time constraints. I have tried to branch off main as demo of version control and create Pull requests as I would normally creating feature branches. Possible better state management would be to use Redux but for an SPA I though hooks were fine. I chose typescript as this tends to cut down on bugs. Material UI was a bit of a learning curve and I used SASS with some overlap there.
